Indians and Turks are buying more gold as celebrations such as weddings and festivals drive spending. Jewelry stores in both countries reported strong sales growth, boosted by regional events such as India's Diwali and Turkey's Eid al-Fitr. This surge in demand is likely to fuel further price gains in the gold market, analysts say.
